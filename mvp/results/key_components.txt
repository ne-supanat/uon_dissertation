Here's a selection of key components and codes from the provided texts, optimized for building an Agent-Based Model focused on transportation choices for commuting, given traveller characteristics and predicting transportation type usage:

**Actors**
- "Individual Commuter/Participant"
    - "I usually wake up around 6:30 a.m., have a light breakfast, and then head out by 7:30." (Captures individual starting point)
    - "I live about 10 kilometers from my workplace, so I cycle most days." (Highlights individual mode choice).
- "Other commuters (implied)"
    - "I talk to friends who say they’d love to bike or take public transport, but the lack of safe bike lanes or inconsistent bus schedules puts them off." (Influence on mode choice)

**Archetype**
- "Pragmatic Commuter"
    -   "Yes, if it’s raining heavily or I’m feeling unwell, I take the bus." (Illustrates condition-based decision-making).
- "Environmentally Aware Commuter"
    -  "I started feeling guilty about my car basically puffing out fumes every day. I’m not a “perfect eco-warrior” or anything, but I figured if I could cut down on emissions and stress at the same time… win-win, right?"(Highlights environmental concerns impacting choice)

**Social/Psychological Aspect**
- "Convenience and Comfort Preferences"
    -   "I talk to friends who say they’d love to bike or take public transport, but the lack of safe bike lanes or inconsistent bus schedules puts them off." (Illustrates the importance of convenience as an influence)
- "Influence of Perceived Convenience"
    - "I’m lucky—my route is easy." (highlights route characteristics and easy access influencing mode choices)

**Key Activities**
- "Choosing Mode of Transport"
    - "I live about 10 kilometers from my workplace, so I cycle most days."(Highlights the process of selecting the transportation)
    - "Yes, if it’s raining heavily or I’m feeling unwell, I take the bus."(Highlights the condition of selecting transportation)
- "Tram Commuting"
    - "Mostly by tram, actually. I used to drive, but sitting in traffic every morning was driving me a bit mad. Now, I just hop on the tram, scroll through memes or read the news, and boom—I’m at work in 20 minutes." (Highlights the impact of commuting)

**Physical Component**
- "Bicycle"
    - "I cycle most days." (Highlights one transportation)
- "Bus"
    - "Yes, if it’s raining heavily or I’m feeling unwell, I take the bus."(Highlights another transportation)
- "Public Transportation System"
    - "Mostly by tram, actually." (Highlights another transportation)

**Interactions**
- "Participant-Employer (Through Cycle-to-Work Scheme)"
    -   "They actually have a cycle-to-work scheme, which I joined. We also have secure bike storage and showers, which makes it easier."(Highlights impact of scheme to individual)
- "System Constraints on Individual"
    -   "Honestly? Just make it easier and cheaper. If public transport is reliable, clean, and not wildly expensive, more people will use it. Same with cycling—give us safe bike lanes and people will ride." (Highlights system characteristics impacting mode choices)
