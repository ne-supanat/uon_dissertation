data/mvp_1.txt;Actors;Individual Commuter;I usually wake up around 6:30 a.m., have a light breakfast, and then head out by 7:30.
data/mvp_1.txt;Actors;Individual Commuter;I actually switched to biking regularly about two years ago.
data/mvp_1.txt;Actors;Colleagues;I also sometimes carpool with a colleague if we have early meetings.
data/mvp_1.txt;Actors;Colleagues;A few of my colleagues have switched to biking too.
data/mvp_1.txt;Archetypes;Sustainable Commuter;Yes, most of the time. I actually switched to biking regularly about two years ago.
data/mvp_1.txt;Archetypes;Sustainable Commuter;Plus, I enjoy it! It’s energizing and gives me time to think.
data/mvp_1.txt;Archetypes;Environmentally Conscious Citizen;I was reading articles and listening to podcasts about climate change, and it struck me that transportation is such a big contributor.
data/mvp_1.txt;Archetypes;Environmentally Conscious Citizen;I think it’s one of the areas where individual choices can have a real impact.
data/mvp_1.txt;Physical Components;Bicycle;I live about 10 kilometers from my workplace, so I cycle most days.
data/mvp_1.txt;Physical Components;Bicycle;Instead of sitting in a jam, I’m cruising past traffic on a bike lane.
data/mvp_1.txt;Physical Components;Public Transportation (Bus);Yes, if it’s raining heavily or I’m feeling unwell, I take the bus.
data/mvp_1.txt;Physical Components;Public Transportation (Bus);And when I take the bus, I use the time to read or listen to audiobooks.
data/mvp_1.txt;Social Aspect;Workplace Culture;Definitely. They actually have a cycle-to-work scheme, which I joined.
data/mvp_1.txt;Social Aspect;Workplace Culture;There’s a really nice culture of encouraging sustainable habits there.
data/mvp_1.txt;Social Aspect;Social Influence;A few of my colleagues have switched to biking too.
data/mvp_1.txt;Social Aspect;Social Influence;I talk to friends who say they’d love to bike or take public transport, but the lack of safe bike lanes or inconsistent bus schedules puts them off.
data/mvp_1.txt;Psychological Aspect;Personal Wellbeing;I feel fitter, and I’m less stressed during rush hour.
data/mvp_1.txt;Psychological Aspect;Personal Wellbeing;It’s just a more peaceful start to the day.
data/mvp_1.txt;Psychological Aspect;Sense of Contribution;I thought, “If I can do something small but consistent, maybe it helps in the long run.”
data/mvp_1.txt;Psychological Aspect;Sense of Contribution;And don’t underestimate how good it feels to be part of the solution.
data/mvp_1.txt;Misc;Distance;I live about 10 kilometers from my workplace
data/mvp_1.txt;Misc;Weather;depending on traffic and weather.
data/mvp_1.txt;Misc;Weather;Yes, if it’s raining heavily or I’m feeling unwell, I take the bus.
data/mvp_1.txt;Key Activities;Commuting Choice;I used to drive, but I started thinking more about my carbon footprint—and honestly, it just felt better to be more active in the mornings.
data/mvp_1.txt;Key Activities;Commuting Choice;Start small. Maybe bike one or two days a week, or try the bus for a few days and see how it fits your routine.
data/mvp_1.txt;Key Activities;Advocacy and Awareness;I talk to friends who say they’d love to bike or take public transport, but the lack of safe bike lanes or inconsistent bus schedules puts them off.
data/mvp_1.txt;Key Activities;Advocacy and Awareness;Hopefully, more people will give it a try.
data/mvp_2.txt;Actors;Individual Commuter;I’m not a morning person at all, but I manage to crawl out of bed around 7:15.
data/mvp_2.txt;Actors;Individual Commuter;I’m less grumpy in the mornings, I save money, and I don’t have to panic about finding parking anymore.
data/mvp_2.txt;Actors;Workplace Environment;We’ve got a bike rack, some people use it religiously.
data/mvp_2.txt;Actors;Workplace Environment;They also give out travel vouchers for public transport, which is sweet.
data/mvp_2.txt;Archetypes;Eco-conscious commuter;I’m not a “perfect eco-warrior” or anything, but I figured if I could cut down on emissions and stress at the same time… win-win, right?
data/mvp_2.txt;Archetypes;Eco-conscious commuter;I recycle, I try not to waste food, and I walk or use public transport when I can.
data/mvp_2.txt;Archetypes;Pragmatic commuter;Traffic was a nightmare, parking was expensive, and I started feeling guilty about my car basically puffing out fumes every day.
data/mvp_2.txt;Archetypes;Pragmatic commuter;I think a lot of people want to, but life gets in the way. You’ve got families, long commutes, weird schedules.
data/mvp_2.txt;Physical Components;Tram System;Mostly by tram, actually.
data/mvp_2.txt;Physical Components;Tram System;Now, I just hop on the tram, scroll through memes or read the news, and boom—I’m at work in 20 minutes.
data/mvp_2.txt;Physical Components;Bicycle;I’ve thought about biking more often, but I need to invest in one that doesn’t squeak like a haunted house.
data/mvp_2.txt;Physical Components;Bicycle;We’ve got a bike rack, some people use it religiously.
data/mvp_2.txt;Social Aspect;Workplace support for sustainable commuting;There’s definitely a culture of “hey, let’s not destroy the planet if we don’t have to,” which I appreciate.
data/mvp_2.txt;Social Aspect;Workplace support for sustainable commuting;They also give out travel vouchers for public transport, which is sweet.
data/mvp_2.txt;Social Aspect;Community infrastructure;give us safe bike lanes and people will ride.
data/mvp_2.txt;Social Aspect;Community infrastructure;It shouldn’t feel like you need a survival kit just to bike to work.
data/mvp_2.txt;Psychological Aspect;Stress reduction;Traffic was a nightmare, parking was expensive, and I started feeling guilty about my car basically puffing out fumes every day.
data/mvp_2.txt;Psychological Aspect;Stress reduction;I’m less grumpy in the mornings, I save money, and I don’t have to panic about finding parking anymore.
data/mvp_2.txt;Psychological Aspect;Enjoyment of commute;I just hop on the tram, scroll through memes or read the news, and boom—I’m at work in 20 minutes.
data/mvp_2.txt;Psychological Aspect;Enjoyment of commute;If the weather’s nice, I’ll walk. It takes about 45 minutes, but I throw on a podcast and it’s actually pretty relaxing.
data/mvp_2.txt;Misc;Distance;I work in the city center, about 6 or 7 kilometers from home.
data/mvp_2.txt;Misc;Distance;It takes about 45 minutes, but I throw on a podcast and it’s actually pretty relaxing.
data/mvp_2.txt;Misc;Weather;If the weather’s nice, I’ll walk.
data/mvp_2.txt;Misc;Weather;Sometimes, yeah! If the weather’s nice, I’ll walk.
data/mvp_2.txt;Key Activities;Choosing a commute method;I used to drive, but sitting in traffic every morning was driving me a bit mad.
data/mvp_2.txt;Key Activities;Choosing a commute method;I’m trying to be more mindful without going extreme. Like, I recycle, I try not to waste food, and I walk or use public transport when I can.
data/mvp_2.txt;Key Activities;Interacting with public transport;Mostly by tram, actually.
data/mvp_2.txt;Key Activities;Interacting with public transport;Just make it easier and cheaper. If public transport is reliable, clean, and not wildly expensive, more people will use it.
data/mvp_3.txt;Actors;Commuters;people will naturally make better choices without needing constant moral pressure.
data/mvp_3.txt;Actors;Commuters;Most people aren’t against sustainable transport—they just find it harder.
data/mvp_3.txt;Actors;City Planners/Designers;If we design systems better—trains, buses, bike infrastructure—people will naturally make better choices
data/mvp_3.txt;Actors;City Planners/Designers;Integrated planning. I’d focus on synchronizing modes—bus, train, bike—with a single, unified platform.
data/mvp_3.txt;Archetypes;Sustainable Commuter;Eventually I settled on the train because it’s the most predictable and time-efficient for my route.
data/mvp_3.txt;Archetypes;Sustainable Commuter;I’m not someone who’s driven by slogans, but I care about long-term impact.
data/mvp_3.txt;Archetypes;Pragmatic Commuter;If it’s slower, more confusing, or less comfortable than driving, they’ll default to the car.
data/mvp_3.txt;Archetypes;Pragmatic Commuter;Yes, and I do it occasionally when the weather’s right and I don’t need to carry too much.
data/mvp_3.txt;Physical Components;Transportation Infrastructure;trains, buses, bike infrastructure
data/mvp_3.txt;Physical Components;Transportation Infrastructure;more park-and-ride stations or bike-share hubs
data/mvp_3.txt;Physical Components;Ticketing Systems;better integration of ticketing systems.
data/mvp_3.txt;Physical Components;Ticketing Systems;One pass, one system, clear information.
data/mvp_3.txt;Social Aspect;Community Benefits;fewer individual cars on the road benefits everyone.
data/mvp_3.txt;Social Aspect;Community Benefits;People talk about their commute in terms of quality of life, not just cost or speed.
data/mvp_3.txt;Social Aspect;Cyclist Integration;Until cities treat cyclists as full participants in the network, adoption will be uneven.
data/mvp_3.txt;Social Aspect;Cyclist Integration;lane coverage, aggressive driving behavior.
data/mvp_3.txt;Psychological Aspect;Stress Reduction;I also find I can use the time more productively—reading, planning, or sometimes just mentally resetting.
data/mvp_3.txt;Psychological Aspect;Stress Reduction;Reducing stress, improving fitness, saving money—these things add up.
data/mvp_3.txt;Psychological Aspect;Perception of Convenience;Convenience and perception.
data/mvp_3.txt;Psychological Aspect;Perception of Convenience;Once people stop worrying about the “how” and focus on the “why,” adoption will follow.
data/mvp_3.txt;Misc;Climate Change;Transportation is one of the more solvable areas in climate policy.
data/mvp_3.txt;Misc;Climate Change;I care about long-term impact.
data/mvp_3.txt;Misc;City Environment;urban cycling still comes with risk factors
data/mvp_3.txt;Misc;City Environment;the weather’s right and I don’t need to carry too much
data/mvp_3.txt;Key Activities;Commute Decision Making;I’ve experimented with different options over the years—driving, biking, walking combinations.
