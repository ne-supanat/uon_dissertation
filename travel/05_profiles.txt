  "summary": "The interviewee is a retired economics teacher living in Crediton. He primarily uses his car for local travel due to convenience and a perceived lack of viable public transport options, especially for work-related travel to more remote locations. Cost is a factor for longer journeys, influencing him to use public transport to airports or for leisure trips when economical. He values the convenience and comfort of car travel, even if it's not the cheapest option. He acknowledges the need for transport changes due to congestion but believes it will be driven by necessity rather than environmental concerns. He is critical of current transport policy, particularly the lack of efficient cargo transport by rail. He envisions an ideal transport system with continuous loop trams and improved rail connectivity.",

    "It does at one level and not at another. I think that for the local bits, I don’t actually, I am not aware of how much roughly I spend on petrol.",
    "So cost is important in that respect, cost isn’t important in local issues. If it’s pouring with rain I will use the car to drive to the shops, five hundred yards away, almost.",
    "Well yes I think it is, because I make the value judgement, being an ex economics teacher there is as far as I am concerned I make the judgement, well I would prefer to spend the money than the experience that not spending money, or reducing the money.",

    "It’s noisy, inconvenient, it’s slow, you have to stand around in the rain to get it, all of those things makes it an unattractive proposition.",
    "Well because I am mostly retired time isn’t a huge factor so it is an issue which relates to me particularly going into Exeter and the issue which is slightly different is the out of town nature of some of the places that I want to go to visit.",
    "I don’t think I feel any pressure personally to change the way I exist in relation to the environment, global warming, whatever. I am a great, my belief is that people will only make changes that they see are practical to them, you can’t un invent the convenience of having their own cars.",
    "I think the changes have got to come with, with innovations, I think we have got to look at public transport in a different way. It seems to me that using old buses more and more isn’t the way.",
    "You have got to improve the quality of the experience before people will make change, because they will make that as a positive choice, you know."

  "summary": "The interviewee is a female resident of Cullompton with a family. Cost is not a primary factor in her daily travel choices as she and her husband own cars. However, she prefers walking for short journeys and uses park and ride for trips to Exeter. Car travel is seen as expensive but necessary due to limited public transport options in Cullompton. She values the time efficiency and flexibility of car travel. She acknowledges the need for changes in travel behavior, particularly concerning younger generations and environmental issues, but emphasizes the importance of global efforts and infrastructure improvements.",

    "Doesn’t come into it at all really, I don’t think. I can afford to run a car and my husband can afford to run a car and so we run two cars.",
    "Yes we do walk an awful lot of places, we don’t use the car for short journeys, it’s mainly for sort of travelling to Exeter for example and then we would get a park and ride bus into Exeter, so we are sort of using public transport as well, but yes the cost isn’t influencing us in that way.",
    "Not really. No I do use the car as little as possible, preferring to walk when there is time and it’s within walking distance really, but it is expensive to run a car and to maintain a car and it is a biggest waste of money that you’ve go I think.",
    "Definitely because you can go when you want to go, you are not tied by a timetable.",
    "Yes I would if it was more convenient. If it was more direct as well I suppose, not so many, I suppose it’s not fair on the outside villages if they don’t have a service. But definitely a train would be more beneficial in Collumpton especially, I am thinking of myself now, but maybe more cycle paths, more cycling, more secure places to store bikes around, that maybe something that would help, more education for children I think to use bikes and think about the way they travel, it’s got to start really at the teenagers, if people are willing to get off their backsides and walk more often!"

The over dependence on cars but then you would have to sort of change the whole area that you live in so that you have, you know, the local shop and the local school and it’s the knock on effect, people choose schools these days, they don’t just go to the local one so there is a lot of commuting there.",
