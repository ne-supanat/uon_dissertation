  "summary": "The interviewee is a retired ex-economics teacher who lives in a semi-rural environment. Cost influences his travel choices for longer journeys, especially regarding airport travel, where he prefers public transport. For local travel, convenience outweighs cost, and he uses his car frequently, despite acknowledging it may not be the most economical option. He values time efficiency but prioritizes comfort and convenience, making him resistant to significant changes in travel behavior unless forced by circumstances like congestion. He is skeptical of current transport policies and favors improvements in public transport quality over penalizing car use.",

    "Yes we do walk an awful lot of places, we don’t use the car for short journeys, it’s mainly for sort of travelling to Exeter for example and then we would get a park and ride bus into Exeter, so we are sort of using public transport as well, but yes the cost isn’t influencing us in that way.",
    "Definitely because you can go when you want to go, you are not tied by a timetable.",
    "Yes I would if it was more convenient.",

    "I don’t think it has a significant affect on my day to day travel, obviously I’ve noticed a significant increase in the price of fuel, as everybody has and I have strong views about this, I believe that the public, the man in the street is being used by large corporations and also the government to capitalise on profits and I include the government in the profit making as they have got to fund things, but you know there seems to be a sort of a general trend to bleed the public as much as you can.",
    "Well it’s not cost effective if I had the time to use public, I am retired and therefore I have got a bus pass.",
    "Which I am grateful for, not that I use it that much, but I think the convenience of cars out strip the sometimes inconvenience of public transport and I don’t feel in my car that I am tied to anybodies problem, expect my own.",
    "I think there used to be more of a sort of national effort on looking at making public transport more accessible, more frequent, more, and cheaper.",
    "I think we need to…it ought to be cheaper and as quick to travel by public transport as it does by car.",
    "It’s almost like a sort of, it’s an ethos almost isn’t it, we have become slaves to our cars for the very simple reason that it is convenient, if we were, if you were able to make public transport convenient, I am not saying everybody would do it, because there is a world worship of the car, it’s no longer the nice thing that you take out on a Sunday, it’s your left leg, you know or your right arm, you can’t do with it, then the generations that follow me, they are so conditioned to use the car, that they don’t know how to use, it’s a bit like that old song, you know everyone’s gone to the moon, where everybody will be walking around with wheels one day, because they don’t need to use their legs and legs will disappear, people that are born without legs will have wheels.",
    "I don’t think the government wants to change the transport system particularly.",
    "I think they want the tax revenue from fuel and I think if you reduced the, the amount of motor cars on the road, you would reduce the fuel tax to the government and therefore they would have to find another way of raising revenue, it’s a bit like the Shylark in Shakespeare, their money lenders, the government are money lenders, it gives you fuel, wants you to use fuel, but doesn’t want you to use fuel, they don’t want you to drive but they want money that you create by driving.",
    "Increased frequency of bus and rail services, obviously that would, I believe that would have, eventually have an impact on and reduce the traffic density and congestion and use of fuel, without a doubt.",
    "I am not so sure smart card ticketing is particularly relevant, I mean it would be nice, it would be easy to do, but reduced fares are the major key factor in getting people to jump on a bus, or a train."

    "So why would I pay 3 times the price for something I don’t want.",

    "Not for local travel, no.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "Well I think that, I was in London a few days ago and it’s absolutely jammed up with travel, now to be fare it’s a great deal less now then there used to be before they actually had the charges, but it’s still incredibly full.",
    "So yes I think there would be, my preference would certainly to be to have much more public transport than incidents where you have to use the car.",
    "Well apart from environmentalism which is a basic it’s really to do with the Cities.",
    "I think in a situation in which you have a large number of people living together, the less amount of individual transport of which you use the better the City will actually be.",
    "I don’t even know there is one.",
    "Well okay if you really want to go down that route then I think that the privatisation of railway was an absolutely disaster and I think it needs, there is no single national way forward on trains, the same is largely true of buses.",
    "Categorically not.",
    "I think it’s total bullshit!",
    "I would like it to be true, but I don’t know how they are going to commit to doing it.",
    "Indeed.",
    "Well I think a combination of public transport and private transport, I mean just for example I have a diesel car and I am running on bio diesel for the last sort of 5 years, and it works fine, it’s just very expensive and you know the commissions are comparably low but the carbon emissions to produce the recycled bio fuel themselves are actually comparably high.",
    "Equally if buses and trams and trains and indeed aircraft could actually have nil emissions or, you know, virtually no emissions then that would be a great combination, so my ideal situation would be to have bicycles, nil emission private cars and nil emission on public transport.",
    "Well if they are all lower emission I am perfectly comfortable having a combination.",
    "I think scenario 3 is probably the one that would actually work, with the exception of the restriction of the number of cars each household could own.",
    "I think so, yes.",
    "The only thing is basically if you happen to be incredibly rich why would you care, if you are medium rich then it becomes an aspiration to get rich enough that you can actually do carbon emissions.",
    "So, I mean so much of the stuff is to do with the economics, it’s not necessarily to do with social responsibility, It’s not necessarily just to do with society, so the idea of banning vehicles for high pollution engines I think is a fantastic idea and I would vote for that, you know on day one.",
    "No car days, yes I don’t think that’s an issue.",
    "Full or part pedestrianisation of urban cities, absolutely.",
    "Restriction the number of cars each household, maybe.",
    "Major and sustained decrease in traffic levels, yes absolutely makes perfect sense.",
    "Rubbish, don’t believe a word of them.",
    "Well I don’t believe in carbon offsetting schemes, mostly they talk about doing things like, there’s one in South America which is planting new trees as an offset, but the only thing of course is what they do is they cut them down and it is complete rubbish.",
    "The idea is it’s a great way of making money, but it has absolutely no fact on carbon emissions.",
    "In fact if anything it is more carbon emissions on this carbon offsetting, I think they are completely corrupt and I don’t believe a word of them.",
    "Incentivise UK holidays, perhaps through tax breaks or not paying VAT for UK holidays, yes I think that is a very good idea indeed.",
    "Tax payers tickets, based on the environmental performance of the aircraft, that I think does make very good sense.",
    "If they provide citizens with a carbon budgets, restricting the amount of carbon in terms of activities I think that is a very good idea.",
    "It doesn't work for me because I don’t do regular things, I don’t sort of travel into work, now I do know people who do car sharing and not Car Share Devon but they do travel together, they actually travel in from this area into the same place on a regular basis.",
    "It probably wouldn’t for me because I don’t, I can’t really predict when I am going to need to use the car.",
    "Oh that does come into it yes.",
    "No I am not particularly concerned about owning my own car, yes if I have access to one all the time, that would be perfect.",

    "Basically what happens is it’s an absolute, then what will happen is the industry actually put the time and money and the effort into developing alternatives, at the moment they have lots of time and they put all the money into developing what they have done at the moment."
