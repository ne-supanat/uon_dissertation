He uses his car regularly, valuing the convenience and comfort it provides, despite the cost. He acknowledges the need for changes in travel behavior due to congestion and environmental concerns but believes change will be driven by necessity rather than choice. He favors improving the quality and network of public transport and is open to paying extra taxes if the improvements are delivered effectively.",
  "quotes": [
    "I think change will come but it will be change that will be forced on people by their circumstances",
    "I think congestion is likely to bring about the major changes. If you can’t get on the train and you can’t get on a bus you can’t park your car, you can’t do the things that are convenient you stop doing them.",
    "You have got to improve the quality of the experience before people will make change, because they will make that as a positive choice",

  "summary": "The interviewee is a mother of two who lives in Collumpton. Cost is not a major factor in her travel choices as she and her husband can afford to run two cars, which they need for their busy family life. She prefers to walk for short journeys and uses park and ride buses for trips to Exeter. She acknowledges the expense of car ownership and maintenance. She supports improving public transport infrastructure and affordability, especially bus and rail links. She is concerned about congestion and environmental issues, advocating for global solutions and local initiatives like walking to school.",
  "quotes": [
    "Doesn’t come into it at all really, I don’t think. I can afford to run a car and my husband can afford to run a car and so we run two cars.",
    "Yes we do walk an awful lot of places, we don’t use the car for short journeys, it’s mainly for sort of travelling to Exeter for example and then we would get a park and ride bus into Exeter, so we are sort of using public transport as well, but yes the cost isn’t influencing us in that way.",
    "Not really. No I do use the car as little as possible, preferring to walk when there is time and it’s within walking distance really, but it is expensive to run a car and to maintain a car and it is a biggest waste of money that you’ve go I think.",
    "Yes I think so, in this generation certainly will need to think about it in a different way, I think maybe that needs to be an infrastructure set up, not necessarily from individuals I think it needs to be more of an infrastructure put into place for, to make it easier for people to travel on public transport.",
    "Well if we change the way we travel the rest of the world has to take that on board as well, there is no point us doing it and China not having the measures in place as well.",
    "definitely more links, not rail links, more bus links, more affordable bus links as well, make it more affordable for everyone to change. Definitely a train station would change the way I travelled and it’s a cheaper way of moving around, rather than using the bus."

  "summary": "The interviewee is a retired individual with a bus pass, who values convenience over cost when it comes to daily travel. While acknowledging the rising cost of fuel and its impact on his finances, he primarily uses a car for its time efficiency and flexibility. He believes public transport should be cheaper, more frequent, and more convenient to encourage greater adoption. He expresses skepticism towards cycling infrastructure and car sharing schemes, citing societal laziness and lack of community interaction as barriers. He supports national subsidies for public transport and honest taxation to fund improvements.",
  "quotes": [
    "I don’t think it has a significant affect on my day to day travel...On a day to day basis I live with it because I don’t have a choice, but it has a significant impact on my bank account, which it didn’t used to have.",
    "Well it’s not cost effective if I had the time to use public, I am retired and therefore I have got a bus pass...but I think the convenience of cars out strip the sometimes inconvenience of public transport",
    "I think there used to be more of a sort of national effort on looking at making public transport more accessible, more frequent, more, and cheaper. I think we need to…it ought to be cheaper and as quick to travel by public transport as it does by car. If that was the case then a lot of people would not use their cars.",
    "It’s almost like a sort of, it’s an ethos almost isn’t it, we have become slaves to our cars for the very simple reason that it is convenient, if we were, if you were able to make public transport convenient...then the generations that follow me, they are so conditioned to use the car, that they don’t know how to use",
    "Increased frequency of bus and rail services, obviously that would, I believe that would have, eventually have an impact on and reduce the traffic density and congestion and use of fuel, without a doubt.",
    "Major improvements in cycling facilities, well to an extent I think probably in some cities and Exeter is an example, there has been an overreaction to the incentive to get people on the bike...my observations are that the cycle tracks around that are growing all the time are not being used"

  "quotes": [
    "Well I think that, I was in London a few days ago and it’s absolutely jammed up with travel...So yes I think there would be, my preference would certainly to be to have much more public transport than incidents where you have to use the car.",
    "Well apart from environmentalism which is a basic it’s really to do with the Cities. I think in a situation in which you have a large number of people living together, the less amount of individual transport of which you use the better the City will actually be.",
    "I think scenario 3 is probably the one that would actually work, with the exception of the restriction of the number of cars each household could own. But I think the rest of it is quite viable and might actually work.",
    "I don’t believe in carbon offsetting schemes, mostly they talk about doing things like, there’s one in South America which is planting new trees as an offset, but the only thing of course is what they do is they cut them down and it is complete rubbish.",
    "Well the key message they need to hear is that travel has got nil carbon emission."

    "Probably not but I suppose I factored it into my life.",
    "Yes. Because if I do go out, I can do the shopping and go somewhere else at the same time and usually I don’t just do one thing I sort of do a set of, not jobs, but sort of tasks while I am out. So yes I do find that time comes into it.",
    "Well certainly the over use of roads, because they are very crowded. The over dependence on cars but then you would have to sort of change the whole area that you live in so that you have, you know, the local shop and the local school and it’s the knock on effect, people choose schools these days, they don’t just go to the local one so there is a lot of commuting there.",
    "And obviously the influence on the environment and the fuel, becoming shorter and the energy disappearing.",
    "I think that the only way they can influence transport policies is to provide more, I mean I think you will get a lot more people going on buses when they have free bus passes and I don’t see why they can’t make local travel anyway a lot cheaper and a lot more user friendly as it were.",
    "Well one thing has changed already in that, during the summer I have been cycling to the supermarket, not for the weekly shop, the big one, because I can’t carry it. But at other times but that is because they have actually put in cycle lanes now which I can access and they are reasonably flat, because at my age I do not want to be going up and down steep hills and in among all the traffic. So that has influenced me.",
    "I think people would object to it but I think, yes I think it would just make them think and make them realise that they can do it a different way and yes I don’t know how it works, whether it is just one area that is you don’t have cars that particular day or, I don’t understand the planning behind it, but yes I think it would focus people.",
    "I think that’s a get out to be honest.",
    "I just cannot see how it would be policed.",
    "It would probably be financial, basically. It was too expensive and if the rail alternative is offered then I think that would be the motivation."
