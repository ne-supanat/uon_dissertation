  "summary": "The interviewee is a mostly retired ex-economics teacher who values cost and convenience in travel choices. Cost is important for longer journeys, influencing the use of public transport to airports. For local travel, convenience outweighs cost, especially when weather is a factor. He acknowledges the necessity of car travel for work due to limited public transport options. He is open to public transport if quality and convenience improve, and supports nationalizing transport infrastructure. He is skeptical of carbon offsetting schemes and prefers incentivizing sustainable choices over penalizing car use.",

    "You have got to improve the quality of the experience before people will make change, because they will make that as a positive choice, you know."

Cost is not a primary concern, but she acknowledges the expense of car ownership and usage. She expresses a willingness to use public transport if it were more convenient, direct, and affordable. She supports improvements to public transport and cycling infrastructure and is open to congestion charges and increased car taxes for more polluting vehicles. She believes that behavioral changes need to start with education in schools.",
  "quotes": [
    "Doesn’t come into it at all really, I don’t think.",
    "Yes we do walk an awful lot of places, we don’t use the car for short journeys, it’s mainly for sort of travelling to Exeter for example and then we would get a park and ride bus into Exeter, so we are sort of using public transport as well, but yes the cost isn’t influencing us in that way.",
    "Not really.",
    "Definitely because you can go when you want to go, you are not tied by a timetable.",
    "Yes I think so, in this generation certainly will need to think about it in a different way, I think maybe that needs to be an infrastructure set up, not necessarily from individuals I think it needs to be more of an infrastructure put into place for, to make it easier for people to travel on public transport.",
    "I probably wouldn’t need to change my behaviour necessarily because I don’t tend to use the car hugely anyway.",
    "Well if we change the way we travel the rest of the world has to take that on board as well, there is no point us doing it and China not having the measures in place as well.",

  "summary": "The interviewee is a retired individual who values convenience over cost when it comes to daily travel. While acknowledging the rising fuel prices and their impact, they primarily use a car due to its convenience and time efficiency compared to public transport. They possess a free bus pass but only utilize it when time is not a constraint. They express skepticism towards cycling facilities and emphasize the need for cheaper, more convenient, and reliable public transport to encourage behavioral change. They also highlight a societal shift towards laziness and car dependence.",
  "quotes": [
    "I don’t think it has a significant affect on my day to day travel, obviously I’ve noticed a significant increase in the price of fuel, as everybody has and I have strong views about this, I believe that the public, the man in the street is being used by large corporations and also the government to capitalise on profits and I include the government in the profit making as they have got to fund things, but you know there seems to be a sort of a general trend to bleed the public as much as you can.",
    "Well it’s not cost effective if I had the time to use public, I am retired and therefore I have got a bus pass.",
    "Which I am grateful for, not that I use it that much, but I think the convenience of cars out strip the sometimes inconvenience of public transport and I don’t feel in my car that I am tied to anybodies problem, expect my own.",
    "I think we need to…it ought to be cheaper and as quick to travel by public transport as it does by car.",
    "It’s almost like a sort of, it’s an ethos almost isn’t it, we have become slaves to our cars for the very simple reason that it is convenient, if we were, if you were able to make public transport convenient, I am not saying everybody would do it, because there is a world worship of the car, it’s no longer the nice thing that you take out on a Sunday, it’s your left leg, you know or your right arm, you can’t do with it, then the generations that follow me, they are so conditioned to use the car, that they don’t know how to use, it’s a bit like that old song, you know everyone’s gone to the moon, where everybody will be walking around with wheels one day, because they don’t need to use their legs and legs will disappear, people that are born without legs will have wheels.",

Local travel choices are influenced more by convenience and the experience of being present rather than cost.

They are open to using public transport more if it were more accessible and had lower emissions, supporting measures like banning high-emission vehicles and pedestrianizing urban centers.",
  "quotes": [
    "Well if I am going to travel to, well for example I have just been up to London by train, if I travel for, well if I travel so that I am going to arrive before 9 o’clock it’s going to cost me about 3 times the price.",
    "And if I don’t have to arrive before 9 then it’s much cheaper.",
    "So why would I pay 3 times the price for something I don’t want.",
    "Well in terms of cost efficiency the longer you go, obviously it’s aircraft, then trains and then cars.",

    "Not for local travel, no.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "Well I think that, I was in London a few days ago and it’s absolutely jammed up with travel, now to be fare it’s a great deal less now then there used to be before they actually had the charges, but it’s still incredibly full.",
    "So yes I think there would be, my preference would certainly to be to have much more public transport than incidents where you have to use the car.",
    "Well apart from environmentalism which is a basic it’s really to do with the Cities.",
    "I think in a situation in which you have a large number of people living together, the less amount of individual transport of which you use the better the City will actually be.",
    "I think scenario 3 is probably the one that would actually work, with the exception of the restriction of the number of cars each household could own.",
    "But I think the rest of it is quite viable and might actually work.",

    "So, I mean so much of the stuff is to do with the economics, it’s not necessarily to do with social responsibility, It’s not necessarily just to do with society, so the idea of banning vehicles for high pollution engines I think is a fantastic idea and I would vote for that, you know on day one.",
    "Well I don’t believe in carbon offsetting schemes, mostly they talk about doing things like, there’s one in South America which is planting new trees as an offset, but the only thing of course is what they do is they cut them down and it is complete rubbish.",
    "The idea is it’s a great way of making money, but it has absolutely no fact on carbon emissions.",
    "In fact if anything it is more carbon emissions on this carbon offsetting, I think they are completely corrupt and I don’t believe a word of them.",
    "If they provide citizens with a carbon budgets, restricting the amount of carbon in terms of activities I think that is a very good idea.",
    "Well the key message they need to hear is that travel has got nil carbon emission."

    "Probably not but I suppose I factored it into my life.",
    "Well it would be very expensive because I have got a free bus pass so…",
    "Yes.",

    "Well one thing has changed already in that, during the summer I have been cycling to the supermarket, not for the weekly shop, the big one, because I can’t carry it.",
    "But at other times but that is because they have actually put in cycle lanes now which I can access and they are reasonably flat, because at my age I do not want to be going up and down steep hills and in among all the traffic.",
    "So that has influenced me, but I think, what was the question again?",
    "Well I think it would have to be more convenient….I came from Milton Keynes here and each area there was built on a kilometre grid square with inside it there was the shop and the doctor and the local primary school and you know so you could actually access these things very conveniently.",

    "The smart ticketing I think is a good idea because you haven’t always got change and I do appreciate the free bus pass and I think that’s actually, I know they say that it costs a lot but I think in the end it will be cost effective by removing cars from the city centre.",
    "There are many more cycling facilities now and I do appreciate that those are being put in quite frequently now which is good.",
    "Yes and any time there is an improvement in public transport then you have got to get it from tax revenue, you are going to get more people using it.",
    "I think you certainly want to ban vehicles with highly polluting engines.",

    "I certainly think that would be important, yes.",

    "Yes I think people would if they could see how to do it.",

    "It took me a long time to get cycling, yet once I did it I really enjoyed it and, mind you I was a fair weather cyclist.",
    "It would probably be financial, basically.",
    "It was too expensive and if the rail alternative is offered then I think that would be the motivation."
