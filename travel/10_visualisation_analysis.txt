Here's a summary of the findings from the simulation experiment, based on the provided image:

**Overall Trend:**

The graph shows the number of agents using different transport types (Bus, Train, Car) over time (ticks).  A significant event occurs at tick 500, where traffic congestion is introduced.

**Before Congestion (Ticks 0-500):**

*   **Bus:**  The number of agents using the bus is relatively stable, fluctuating around 50.
*   **Train:** The number of agents using the train is also relatively stable, fluctuating around 15-20.
*   **Car:** The number of agents using cars is relatively stable, fluctuating around 30-40.

**After Congestion (Ticks 500 onwards):**

*   **Bus:** The number of agents using the bus *increases* significantly and stabilizes at a higher level, around 60-65.
*   **Train:** The number of agents using the train remains relatively stable, fluctuating around 15-20.
*   **Car:** The number of agents using cars *decreases* significantly and stabilizes at a lower level, around 20-25.

**Explanation:**

The introduction of traffic congestion at tick 500 causes a shift in transport usage.  People likely switch from using cars to using buses to avoid the congestion.  This is reflected in the increase in bus usage and the decrease in car usage after tick 500. Train usage remains relatively unaffected by the congestion, suggesting it might be a separate transport network.
