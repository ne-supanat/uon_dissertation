Perform thematic analysis and identify key theme codes and supporting quotes for Agent-Based Modeling system

Following these key components
-   Actors are agents which can be a person or groups or organisation inside the system
-   Physical components are objects or tools or systems that actors use
-   Social aspect is rules or norms about social behaviour
-   Psychological aspect is rules or norms about psychological behaviour
-   Misc are real world elements that do not fall in any component

-   Key activities are interactions between actors and actors or actors and system environment

Each component has at least 2 codes
Each theme code has maximum of 2 quotes. Quote must be exactly the same as original text and come from the same line.
