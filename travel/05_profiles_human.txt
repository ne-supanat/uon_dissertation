He prioritises the experiences more.He needs to go to work at Halsworthy which has no public transport available. He thinks people will change their habit when it not practical anymore. He likes scenario one (improving public transport) but he thinks the quality of busses is more important than frequency and we should stop keep using old buses. He does not like penalty tax policy because the concerns about its transparency of where taxes spent.",

    "I don’t like penal taxation, a I don’t think it works, b it’s not transparent so it’s very difficult to see that revenues raised in one area are only going to be spent in one area.",
    "You have got to improve the quality of the experience before people will make change, because they will make that as a positive choice, you know.",
    "So in scenario three what I have disbanded, most of that, switch over to a public transport focused infrastructure and then I would go along with that, but it needs a radical examination of what really is required I think."

She agrees on more polluting engine taxes policy. while she is not sure about driving taxes, she is okay with congestion charge as long as other option are available. option 3 (car restriction) is good in her opinion but she believes it is unachievable.

    "I would say congestion charge, definitely, but then you would have to have in place more park and ride schemes, a bigger, much bigger infrastructure.  Definitely increasing car tax for cars emitting more pollutants.  Why do you need a Range Rover if you live in the middle of town, that sort of thing I think.  Not sure about toll roads necessarily but increased parking charges in urban areas I think that would be fine as long as there were more other options, like park and ride and that sort of thing.",
