  "summary": "The interviewee is a retired economics teacher who travels frequently, both locally and internationally. Cost influences his travel choices, especially for longer journeys where he prefers public transport. He values the convenience of car travel for local trips and work-related travel, despite the cost. He acknowledges the need for change in travel behavior due to congestion and environmental problems but believes change will be driven by necessity rather than personal conviction. He is skeptical of current transport policies and advocates for improved public transport quality and efficiency in cargo transport.",

    "So cost is important in that respect, cost isn’t important in local issues. If it’s pouring with rain I will use the car to drive to the shops, five hundred yards away, almost.",
    "Well yes I think it is, because I make the value judgement, being an ex economics teacher there is as far as I am concerned I make the judgement, well I would prefer to spend the money than the experience that not spending money, or reducing the money.",

    "I don’t think I feel any pressure personally to change the way I exist in relation to the environment, global warming, whatever. I am a great, my belief is that people will only make changes that they see are practical to them, you can’t un invent the convenience of having their own cars.",
    "I think the changes have got to come with, with innovations, I think we have got to look at public transport in a different way.",
    "You have got to improve the quality of the experience before people will make change, because they will make that as a positive choice, you know."

Cost is not a primary concern, but time efficiency and the ability to travel on their own schedule are key factors.

    "Yes we do walk an awful lot of places, we don’t use the car for short journeys, it’s mainly for sort of travelling to Exeter for example and then we would get a park and ride bus into Exeter, so we are sort of using public transport as well, but yes the cost isn’t influencing us in that way.",
    "Definitely because you can go when you want to go, you are not tied by a timetable.",
    "Yes I would if it was more convenient. If it was more direct as well I suppose, not so many, I suppose it’s not fair on the outside villages if they don’t have a service. But definitely a train would be more beneficial in Collumpton especially"

    "I think there used to be more of a sort of national effort on looking at making public transport more accessible, more frequent, more, and cheaper.  I think we need to…it ought to be cheaper and as quick to travel by public transport as it does by car.  If that was the case then a lot of people would not use their cars.",

And if I don’t have to arrive before 9 then it’s much cheaper.  So why would I pay 3 times the price for something I don’t want.",

    "Yes. Because if I do go out, I can do the shopping and go somewhere else at the same time and usually I don’t just do one thing I sort of do a set of, not jobs, but sort of tasks while I am out. So yes I do find that time comes into it.",
    "Well certainly the over use of roads, because they are very crowded. The over dependence on cars but then you would have to sort of change the whole area that you live in so that you have, you know, the local shop and the local school and it’s the knock on effect, people choose schools these days, they don’t just go to the local one so there is a lot of commuting there.",

    "Well one thing has changed already in that, during the summer I have been cycling to the supermarket, not for the weekly shop, the big one, because I can’t carry it.

So that has influenced me.",
