Moderator: Good afternoon everybody.  Thank you very much for being here, your help is very much appreciated. My name is Moderator.  I am a researcher from Exeter University. And this meeting is part of our 2 year research project regarding travel behaviour.  We recorded randomly selected people from Crediton for this group meeting and asked them about their travel behaviour and their opinions regarding certain means of transport.  The first thing I wanted to ask you is just the first introduction round – where you can say maybe your name, what you are doing… whatever you want.  Your first name is Ok for me if you don’t want to say your full name.  Starting to my left maybe? 
Liz: Ok.  I’m Liz.  I’m 19.  I’m on a gap year and I am going to University in September.
Cheryl: We’re not actually….we’re from down the road in Newton [1.00].
Moderator: That’s OK.  
...
James: People have something I didn’t get at first.
Moderator: Yeah you can get it too if you want.  
James: Do I want? Is it for me or for you?
Moderator: More for me.
James: Oh it’s not for me?  Then I don’t need it.

Perform thematic analysis and identify key theme codes and supporting quotes for Agent-Based Modeling system

Following these key components
-   Actors are agents which can be a person or groups or organisation inside the system
-   Archetypes are categories of Actors defines what they are allowed or expected to do
-   Physical components are objects or tools or systems that actors use
-   Social aspect is rules or norms about social behaviour
-   Psychological aspect is rules or norms about psychological behaviour
-   Misc are real world elements that do not fall in any component

-   Key activities are interactions between actors and actors or actors and system environment

Each component has at least 2 codes
Each theme code has maximum of 2 quotes. Quote must be exactly the same as original text and come from the same line.

Based on following theme codes & quotes of actors

Residents
- My name is John Jones. I live just around the corner across the park.
- My name is Cheryl.  Just completely coincidentally, I am Liz’s mother.

Commuters
- When I used to commute to work in Exeter.
- I commuted from Exeter to Crediton I generally went by car.

...

Bus Passengers
- I like it when you try and catch a bus by Costcutter at Mount Pleasant into town and 5 buses come by and not one of them are you allowed to catch at certain times of the day because they are coming from Cullompton, it’s park and ride, it’s another park and ride you know.
- That’s so annoying.

Individual Travelers
- I mean I think people actually could walk more than they do, I have no idea how you encourage people to do that, well accept making alternatives very expensive, they would walk because they can’t afford to get anything else.
- But in general I mean I just don’t think people are going to change their transport habits, or any other habits actually.


Select minimum items from the theme codes & quotes that are the most important to build Agent-based modelling simulation with
Objective: to observe travel habits of different lifestyle group
Experiment factors (inputs): number of people in the system
Responses (outputs): travel choices ratio

The final theme codes & quotes has at least 1 code
Each with theme codes description and justification why you select them
