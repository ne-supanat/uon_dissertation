Based on the provided EABSS model, UML diagrams, and archetype action probabilities, I will generate a NetLogo simulation script. The script will model commuters with different archetypes (Eco-Conscious, Convenience-Driven, and Cost-Sensitive) and their daily commuting behavior. The simulation will consider the impact of different policy scenarios on their choice of transport mode (cycling, car, or public transport) and estimate the resulting carbon emissions. The script will also track commuter satisfaction with the implemented policies. The simulation will run for a specified number of ticks, and at the end, it will output the carbon emissions level and commuter satisfaction levels to a CSV file.
