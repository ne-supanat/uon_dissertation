Based on the provided EABSS model, UML diagrams, and archetype action probabilities, I will generate a NetLogo simulation script. The script will model commuters with different archetypes (Eco-Conscious, Convenience-Driven, and Cost-Sensitive) and simulate their commuting behavior under various policy scenarios. The simulation will track carbon emissions and commuter satisfaction as outputs. The script will include setup, go, activity, and save procedures. The save procedure will output the carbon emissions level and commuters' satisfaction to a CSV file.
