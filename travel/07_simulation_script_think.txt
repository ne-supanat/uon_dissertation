Based on the provided EABSS model, UML diagrams, and archetype action probabilities, I will generate a NetLogo simulation script. The script will model commuters choosing between cycling, cars, and public transport based on their assigned archetype (Eco-Conscious, Convenience-Driven, or Cost-Sensitive) and various intervention strategies. The simulation will track carbon emissions and output the final level after a set number of ticks.
