Based on the provided EABSS model, UML diagrams, and archetype action probabilities, I will generate a NetLogo simulation script. The script will model commuters choosing different travel modes (cycling, car, public transport) under various policy scenarios. The simulation will track carbon emissions and commuter satisfaction as outputs, reflecting the model's objective.
