    "I leave home by 7:30 and reach work around 8. I work about 8 kilometers away, and I usually take the train and walk the rest.",

    "If we design systems better—trains, buses, bike infrastructure—people will naturally make better choices without needing constant moral pressure.",
    "Convenience and perception. Most people aren’t against sustainable transport—they just find it harder. If it’s slower, more confusing, or less comfortable than driving, they’ll default to the car. So if we want change, we need to remove those friction points. Infrastructure first, then behavior follows."

  "summary": "The participant commutes 8 kilometers to work, primarily using the train for its predictability and time efficiency. They value sustainability and believe in designing better transportation systems to encourage eco-friendly choices. They prioritize convenience and reducing friction in sustainable transport options.",
