      " - I would like it to be true, but I don’t know how they are going to commit to doing it.\n",
      " - Indeed.\n",
      " - Well I think a combination of public transport and private transport, I mean just for example I have a diesel car and I am running on bio diesel for the last sort of 5 years, and it works fine, it’s just very expensive and you know the commissions are comparably low but the carbon emissions to produce the recycled bio fuel themselves are actually comparably high.\n",

      " - Well certainly the over use of roads, because they are very crowded.\n",
      " - And obviously the influence on the environment and the fuel, becoming shorter and the energy disappearing.\n",
      " - I think that the only way they can influence transport policies is to provide more, I mean I think you will get a lot more people going on buses when they have free bus passes and I don’t see why they can’t make local travel anyway a lot cheaper and a lot more user friendly as it were.\n",
      " - Well one thing has changed already in that, during the summer I have been cycling to the supermarket, not for the weekly shop, the big one, because I can’t carry it.\n",
      " - I don’t use rail services very often but the bus service is I think, the frequency is important, they are fairly punctual and they are fairly reliable as far as I am concerned.\n",
      " - I think that’s a get out to be honest.\n",
      " - I must admit I am morally against the cheap airlines and I think that in a way they become dangerous, because they cut corners so much, but yes I also wouldn’t want to pay an awful lot more but I don’t go on planes very often so.\n",
      " - I just cannot see how it would be policed.\n",
      " - I think that only works if you are going at a particular time in a particular direction and I tend to go in different directions at different times, because I am free to do it when I want to sort of thing.\n",
      " - Yes that might be useful, my husband hasn’t retired yet, but he is due to so we are thinking of going to one car, although (15.23)\n",
      " - It would probably be financial, basically.\n",
      " - It was too expensive and if the rail alternative is offered then I think that would be the motivation.\n",
