That’s what [inaudible 00:29:19] buy one get one free.
Yeah.
Yes.  I don’t know, I find that really annoying.
Why is that?
Well, because I don’t want [inaudible 00:29:27] stuff that I feel I’ve got to, got to eat.  But okay, some of it I keep but no, I just (Overlapping Conversation) I can’t have things, got to be a better [inaudible 00:29:37] way of doing that.
Yes, absolutely.  Okay.  Is there anything that [inaudible 00:29:41] before you start (Overlapping Background Noise) [Supermarket F] but, that they do that’s really good, the people of your age?

Mm-hmm.  I mean, you think….
And why is that important to you?
I don’t know it’s….
What [inaudible 00:30:11]
Why is it important to have freshly made bread and good bread?
Yes, because they (Overlapping Conversation)  My brother [inaudible 00:30:19] one little shop [inaudible 00:30:21] shop making bread and the bread is so good.  He went from one shop to 30 shops.
Wow.

He’d got [inaudible 00:30:29] from one little shop, he has 50 shops.
Okay.
But he’s getting old [inaudible 00:30:35] children run his business.
Okay.
And they’re starting [inaudible 00:30:38] from that.

And, the [inaudible 00:30:44]
His store is getting (Overlapping Conversation)
There are [inaudible 00:30:47] private bakery.  It’s not [inaudible 00:30:50] shops.  (Overlapping Conversation)
But why is it good?  Why is it good to have a bakery?

It’s (Overlapping Conversation)
(Overlapping Conversation) anything like [inaudible 00:31:03]
And I…we bought [inaudible 00:31:07] in the store last week.  It was one at the store [inaudible 00:31:13] (Overlapping Conversation)  My wife saw us and she said, she thought of me straightaway because when I used to be younger as we used to go to a baker and I used to do cottage loaves…
Yes.
Absolutely.
And my mum always used to say to me, ‘[Name, S4] , when you go up there, [inaudible 00:31:31] get burnt (Overlapping Conversation)
That’s right.  That’s (Overlapping Conversation)
And they used to cook with wood [inaudible 00:31:36]  And of course, they had no, no check on the, the heat (Overlapping Conversation)
Uh-huh.
And that’s what we used to (Overlapping Conversation)
Okay.  So this reminds you that (Overlapping Conversation)
And this, that loaf I bought…
Yeah, that.

Okay.  So fresh (Overlapping Conversation)
Yeah, it tasted good.
After all that the people [inaudible 00:31:56] it’s really something [inaudible 00:31:57] you to (Overlapping Conversation)
Oh as you (Overlapping Conversation)
Yes, it…yes.
They never slice it and things like that.
Yeah.
(Laughter)
I used to pick the edge of the loaf.
Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  As soon as they came.
As soon as it came.  So you’ve been to the shop and you, in the end of the loaf that [inaudible 00:32:15]
Oh, I see.
And (Overlapping Conversation)  And that’s when (Overlapping Conversation)
That’s a long time ago.
Right.  Okay.  So (Overlapping Conversation) thing.  What about when you’re shopping in the store?  Are you shopping for anybody else?  Um, pets or any grandchildren or, you know, specifically or (Overlapping Conversation)
Occasionally, buy dog food because we have six dogs.
Oh, wow.  In your (Overlapping Conversation)  Gosh.
My daughter breeds.
Wow.
What, what?
She breeds Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers.  (Overlapping Conversation)
Oh really?
She got two first prizes and [inaudible 00:32:47] the weekend.
Wow.
Yes.
Gosh.
Well done.
So you occasionally buy dog food?
She buys [inaudible 00:32:54] and she buys because she has another special diet.
All right, yes.
(Overlapping Conversation) to get mainly raw food actually.  And she gets that supermarket food stock good enough for them.  And buy dog biscuits and things like that and….
Okay.
They buy things like that.  I get them treats but they’re not supposed to (Overlapping Conversation)
Yeah.
Right, okay.  And what about….
And they, and they know it?
Oh, they know it.  They know the cupboard it’s kept in.
Yeah?  (Laughter)
And there’s food in there and there’s [inaudible 00:33:25] there, trying to force (Overlapping Conversation)
Oh yes.
And what about other people?  Grandchildren or for your children?  Do you….
No.
Do you buy specifically in the supermarket for them?
My wi–…my wife might buy the other thing for my granddaughter, about 10, or [inaudible 00:33:43] daughter but not very often.
Right.
She goes [inaudible 00:33:47] her own thing.  She (Overlapping Conversation)
Okay, yes.
(Overlapping Conversation) my daughter could…my son [inaudible 00:33:52]
Yeah.  Okay.  So you….
I wouldn’t have to worry about that.
Oh, that’s good.  Yeah.  So normally, you’re buying for yourselves then?
Oh (Overlapping Conversation) absolutely, yeah.
My grandchildren are in their 20s and they would not buy [inaudible 00:34:07]
Yes, they (Laughter)  Do you buy clothes in the supermarket?
Yes.
(Overlapping Conversation) you do, yeah?
No, I don’t.
[inaudible 00:34:17]
[inaudible 00:34:19] very trendy.
Oh, I would buy [inaudible 00:34:22] fit me [inaudible 00:34:25] me.  Not terribly keen in the supermarket because they look very nice.  But after you’ve washed them twice, they’re like nothing.
All right.  Okay.  So you might come in for clothes but it’s not…
Yeah.
It’s just while you’re here (Overlapping Conversation)
No.  No (Overlapping Conversation)
Marks and Spencer’s [inaudible 00:34:39]  What about things like electrical items or toasters?
Yes.
Well, they [inaudible 00:34:44] do that.  [inaudible 00:34:45] they’ve got very few television sets here.  You (Overlapping Conversation)
Okay.
Then you go [inaudible 00:34:51] Marks and Spencer’s that [inaudible 00:34:52] electrical (Overlapping Conversation) trying to compete with [inaudible 00:34:56]
There is something…yeah.
(Overlapping Conversation) places like [inaudible 00:34:59] and that prevents [inaudible 00:35:02]
Okay.  (Overlapping Conversation)
But then again [inaudible 00:35:04] there’s a lot of people that [inaudible 00:35:06] and one of them who didn’t like to buy online [inaudible 00:35:08]
Oh, definitely.  Yes.
We never buy online.
Okay.
I don’t buy online.
What were you [inaudible 00:35:14]
I forgot what I was going to say, you know.
It happens all the time.
When we’re talking about toasters and TVs….
Oh, oh yes.  (Overlapping Conversation) smaller things and….
No, that’s (Overlapping Conversation)
…vacuum cleaners and stuff like that.  Oh, yes.  That’s (Overlapping Conversation)
I had bargain sometimes (Overlapping Conversation) quite good bargains after (Overlapping Conversation)
So you might [inaudible 00:35:34]  Okay.  So you’re not just coming here for shopping [inaudible 00:35:39]
Yeah.
I bought a microwave from [Supermarket G].  £17 I got it.  And the whole thing fell apart within a few months.  [inaudible 00:35:49]  All the inside collapsed (Overlapping Conversation) what I’m going to do.
Wow.
Well, I expect (Overlapping Conversation)
(Overlapping Conversation)
[Supermarket G] (Overlapping Conversation)  I do not like [Supermarket G].
What about shopping in small, little, local convenience stores?  How does….
Well, we’ve got a little [Supermarket G] around [inaudible 00:36:08] corner away from us.
(Overlapping Conversation) can just see there [inaudible 00:36:11]
Yeah, I [inaudible 00:36:12]
I (Overlapping Conversation) as [Supermarket G] where [inaudible 00:36:13] I think [inaudible 00:36:14] again.  I’m going to have to see what’s [inaudible 00:36:18] [Supermarket E] house because we’re a smallish town but we have a [Supermarket G] but I don’t go into it.  It’s too expensive.
