Interviewer: Thanks for joining me today. Let’s start with your daily routine—how does a typical workday begin for you?
Participant: Sure. I usually wake up around 6:15. I like to start the day early—some quiet time, check emails, a bit of news. I leave home by 7:30 and reach work around 8. I work about 8 kilometers away, and I usually take the train and walk the rest.
Interviewer: Sounds quite efficient. Is public transport your preferred method?
Participant: It is, yes. I’ve experimented with different options over the years—driving, biking, walking combinations. Eventually I settled on the train because it’s the most predictable and time-efficient for my route. It gets me there within a fixed window almost every day.
Interviewer: What do you like about it compared to driving?
Participant: Several things. For one, it decouples me from traffic unpredictability. I also find I can use the time more productively—reading, planning, or sometimes just mentally resetting. And from a systems perspective, fewer individual cars on the road benefits everyone.
Interviewer: So sustainability played a role in your decision?
Participant: Absolutely. I’m not someone who’s driven by slogans, but I care about long-term impact. Transportation is one of the more solvable areas in climate policy. If we design systems better—trains, buses, bike infrastructure—people will naturally make better choices without needing constant moral pressure.
Interviewer: That’s a thoughtful way of looking at it. Do you feel your city supports sustainable commuting?
Participant: Somewhat. We’ve made good progress in recent years—improved train frequency, better integration of ticketing systems. But there’s still a gap in last-mile convenience. For example, more park-and-ride stations or bike-share hubs would make the switch easier for many people.
Interviewer: Have you ever considered switching to biking full-time?
Participant: Yes, and I do it occasionally when the weather’s right and I don’t need to carry too much. But urban cycling still comes with risk factors—lane coverage, aggressive driving behavior. Until cities treat cyclists as full participants in the network, adoption will be uneven.
Interviewer: That makes sense. What do you think are the biggest challenges in getting more people to adopt sustainable transportation?
Participant: Convenience and perception. Most people aren’t against sustainable transport—they just find it harder. If it’s slower, more confusing, or less comfortable than driving, they’ll default to the car. So if we want change, we need to remove those friction points. Infrastructure first, then behavior follows.
Interviewer: Would you say your work environment encourages this kind of thinking?
Participant: Yes, I’d say so. We have flexible hours, a good remote work policy, and support for cycle commuting. But the real value is cultural. People talk about their commute in terms of quality of life, not just cost or speed. That shift in mindset matters.
Interviewer: That’s really interesting. Has changing your own commute affected other areas of your life?
Participant: It has. I’m more deliberate with my time. I use commute time to disconnect or refocus. It’s made me reflect on how transportation is not just about moving bodies, but about how people experience their day. Reducing stress, improving fitness, saving money—these things add up.
Interviewer: Final question—if you could redesign the city’s transportation system, what’s one thing you’d implement first?
Participant: Integrated planning. I’d focus on synchronizing modes—bus, train, bike—with a single, unified platform. One pass, one system, clear information. Once people stop worrying about the “how” and focus on the “why,” adoption will follow.
Interviewer: Very insightful. Thanks so much for your time—it’s been a pleasure hearing your perspective.
Participant: Likewise. I think conversations like this are important—thank you.
