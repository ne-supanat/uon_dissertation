Ellie: wow
Ellie: that sounds interesting
Ellie: how did you decide to do that
Participant: i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it 
Ellie: nice

Ellie: what do you do when you're annoyed
Participant: vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter>
Ellie: <laughter>
Ellie: yes
Ellie: how are you at controlling your temper
Participant: i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um
Participant: to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control 
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
Participant: <laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting
Participant: getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um
Participant: we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight
Ellie: aww
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: what do you do to relax
Participant: um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people 
Ellie: okay
Ellie: how close are you to your family
Participant: i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh
Participant: couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground
Ellie: i see what you mean
Ellie: do you consider yourself an introvert
Participant: yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i
Participant: seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge 
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: how would your best friend describe you
Participant: i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend
Participant: um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal  
Ellie: that's great
Ellie: what are you most proud of in your life
Participant: i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm
Participant: i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself 
Participant: a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that
Ellie: that's so good to hear
Participant: <laughter>
Ellie: have you ever served in the military
Participant: no i have not
Ellie: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
Participant: no
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: yes
Ellie: how long ago were you diagnosed
Participant: i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago 
Ellie: you were very young weren't you
Participant: yes
Ellie: what got you to seek help
Participant: um i was cutting and my
Participant: one of my best friends called
Participant: um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um
Participant: it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help
Ellie: do you still go to therapy now
Participant: i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks 
Ellie: that sucks
Participant: <laughter>
Ellie: do you feel like therapy's useful
Participant: uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: how have you been feeling lately
Participant: lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and
Participant: my routine of go to school
Participant: and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit 
Participant: weird finding out what to do with my
Participant: finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um
Participant: depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california 
Ellie: yeah that sounds really hard
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um
Participant: about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep 
Participant: sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well
Participant: um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i
Participant: i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um
Participant: i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile
Ellie: i see
Ellie: when was the last time that happened
Participant: probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens  
Ellie: okay
Ellie: when was the last time you felt really happy
Participant: uh <makes sound with mouth>
Participant: really happy i mean um
Participant: i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's
Participant: really happy on new year's eve which was um
Participant: uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them
Participant: i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life
Ellie: that's great
Ellie: what would you say are some of your best qualities
Participant: i think that i'm i'm kind i'm considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open minded i'm aware of my faults
Participant: um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and
Participant: i'm very curious about um about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn 
Ellie: okay
Ellie: what's one of your most memorable experiences
Participant: uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really
Participant: amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this
Participant: uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in
Participant: something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than human and 'cause it's this 
Ellie: wow
Participant: cave system um and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you so 
Participant: that was that was pretty good <laughter> 
Ellie: awesome
Ellie: what are some things you like to do for fun

Participant: just being together with my friends doing um
Participant: relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking playing with my cat
Ellie: okay
Ellie: is there anything you regret
Participant: not that i can really think of i'm sure i've made mistakes in my life but um you know i'm still here so can't be that bad

Participant: i think my boyfriend has he's just um especially the last year he's really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's 
Participant: really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy i should say um to <t> so to see someone overcome that
