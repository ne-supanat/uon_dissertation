Participant: pardon me
Ellie: how did you feel in that moment
Participant: um
Participant: i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh
Participant: just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh
Participant: i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest 
Participant: um
Participant: i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so
Ellie: mhm
Participant: you know and if you're lying about something well
Participant: you just you're always having to cover up uh
Participant: more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just
Participant: don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship

Ellie: i see what you mean
Ellie: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
Participant: um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh
Participant: going on a year um
Participant: you know i uh
Participant: depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um
Participant: so just
Participant: wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts 
Participant: so 
Participant: or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over
Participant: so
Ellie: yeah
Participant: i don't
Participant: lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: do you feel that way often
Participant: uh lately i have been probably about the last few months
Ellie: what are you like when you don't sleep well
Participant: um
Participant: tired <laughter>
Participant: um i you know
Participant: if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work
Participant: um
Participant: and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head
Ellie: mhm
Participant: and so
Participant: you know um
Participant: i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me
Participant: and uh
Participant: so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about
Participant: you know um money um
Participant: you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or
Participant: mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that 
Ellie: mm
Ellie: how do you cope with them
Participant: how do i what
Ellie: how do you cope with them
Participant: how do i cope with them
Participant: um
Participant: i just
Participant: try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um
Participant: i just do it's uh
Participant: i'm more of a guy that just
Participant: you know it may take me a moment to
Participant: to um
Participant: say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews
Ellie: mm
Participant: uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um
Participant: back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me
Ellie: yeah
Ellie: has that gotten you in trouble
Participant: if what has gotten me in trouble
Participant: my mood swing i mean
Ellie: yeah
Participant: um
Participant: yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh
Participant: uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are
Participant: uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh 
Participant: on uh how to interview how to uh
Participant: how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh
Participant: i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who 
Participant: who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done 
Ellie: mhm
Participant: uh
Participant: i've done uh
Participant: i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and 
Participant: and try to uh work on
Participant: the issues that were bothering me so um
Participant: you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school
Participant: and uh
Participant: anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities 
Ellie: mhm
Ellie: that's good
Ellie: do you feel like therapy is useful
Participant: pardon me
Ellie: do you feel like therapy is useful
Participant: i still didn't hear you
Ellie: do you feel like therapy is useful
Participant: that
Participant: people have been deceitful
Participant: can you repeat that one more time
Ellie: why don't we talk about that later
Participant: alright
Ellie: have you been diagnosed with depression
Participant: uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism
Ellie: how hard is that
Participant: um
Participant: it's tough if you don't you know um
Participant: i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um
Participant: again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know
Ellie: mhm
Participant: um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and 
Participant: and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um
Participant: you know
Participant: some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and
Participant: so i just try to cope with things uh
Participant: um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years
Participant: actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um
Participant: whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it  
Participant: um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still 
Participant: uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just
Ellie: yeah
Participant: and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people
Participant: um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so
Participant: um
Participant: but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um
Ellie: mm
Participant: but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um
Participant: you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus
Participant: that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way 
Ellie: yeah
Participant: so i just let it go
Participant: i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad 
Ellie: i understand
Ellie: did you think you had a problem before you found out
Participant: did i have a problem before i got out
Ellie: did you think you had a problem before you found out
Participant: uh
Participant: well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people 
Participant: um
Participant: i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um 
Participant: a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago 
Participant: uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older
Participant: kind of uh
Participant: you know makes it work you know
Ellie: yeah
Participant: me me dealing with life so
Ellie: how has seeing a therapist affected you
Participant: pardon me
Ellie: how has seeing a therapist affected you
Participant: uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while
Participant: uh recently
Participant: and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um
Participant: a lot of people may not understand that but uh
Participant: a therapist is
Participant: i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh
Participant: people you know uh
Participant: uh
Participant: other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like
Participant: you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others
Participant: uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who
Participant: will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know
Ellie: right
Participant: but it's good to have
Ellie: that's so good to hear
Participant: yeah
Ellie: what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
Participant: well i don't go anymore uh so um
Participant: i kinda miss it you know like i said uh
Participant: uh
Participant: i miss it a lot actually but uh
Participant: it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will
Ellie: why did you stop
Participant: um well monetary reasons and uh
Participant: you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um
