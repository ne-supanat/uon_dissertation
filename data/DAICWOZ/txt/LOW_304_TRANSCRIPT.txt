Ellie: mhm
Ellie: can you tell me about that
Participant: um
Participant: just her getting into grown folks' business and
Participant: it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said
Participant: and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter> 
Ellie: oh my gosh
Participant: and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people
Participant: that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that
