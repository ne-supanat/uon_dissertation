Interviewer: Hi there! Thanks for taking the time. Let’s dive in—what’s your usual routine like during the workweek?
Participant: Hey! No problem—happy to chat. So, I’m not a morning person at all, but I manage to crawl out of bed around 7:15. I grab a coffee, stare at the wall for a bit, then leave by 8. I work in the city center, about 6 or 7 kilometers from home.
Interviewer: And how do you usually get to work?
Participant: Mostly by tram, actually. I used to drive, but sitting in traffic every morning was driving me a bit mad. Now, I just hop on the tram, scroll through memes or read the news, and boom—I’m at work in 20 minutes.
Interviewer: Nice! So what made you switch from driving?
Participant: Oh, a bunch of things. Traffic was a nightmare, parking was expensive, and I started feeling guilty about my car basically puffing out fumes every day. I’m not a “perfect eco-warrior” or anything, but I figured if I could cut down on emissions and stress at the same time… win-win, right?
Interviewer: Totally. Would you say sustainability is something you actively think about?
Participant: Yeah, more than I used to. I’m trying to be more mindful without going extreme. Like, I recycle, I try not to waste food, and I walk or use public transport when I can. I don’t own a car anymore, and honestly, I don’t miss it.
Interviewer: Do you ever walk or bike to work?
Participant: Sometimes, yeah! If the weather’s nice, I’ll walk. It takes about 45 minutes, but I throw on a podcast and it’s actually pretty relaxing. I’ve thought about biking more often, but I need to invest in one that doesn’t squeak like a haunted house.
Interviewer: (laughs) That’s fair! How would you describe your workplace’s attitude toward sustainable commuting?
Participant: Pretty supportive. We’ve got a bike rack, some people use it religiously. They also give out travel vouchers for public transport, which is sweet. There’s definitely a culture of “hey, let’s not destroy the planet if we don’t have to,” which I appreciate.
Interviewer: That’s refreshing. Now, big picture—what do you think needs to change in terms of transportation and sustainability?
Participant: Honestly? Just make it easier and cheaper. If public transport is reliable, clean, and not wildly expensive, more people will use it. Same with cycling—give us safe bike lanes and people will ride. It shouldn’t feel like you need a survival kit just to bike to work.
Interviewer: Do you think people are open to making that shift?
Participant: I think a lot of people want to, but life gets in the way. You’ve got families, long commutes, weird schedules. I’m lucky—my route is easy. But yeah, if the system made it simple and actually convenient to go green, more folks would jump on board.
Interviewer: Have you noticed any personal benefits since switching away from driving?
Participant: Oh, 100%. I’m less grumpy in the mornings, I save money, and I don’t have to panic about finding parking anymore. Plus, I’m moving more—those steps add up. My smartwatch is very proud of me.
Interviewer: (laughs) I bet it is. One last thing—any advice for someone who’s thinking about commuting more sustainably?
Participant: Start easy. Try walking or taking the bus once or twice a week. You don’t need to sell your car on day one. Just figure out what fits your life and go from there. And hey—bonus points if you can make it fun. Commutes don’t have to suck!
Interviewer: Great advice. Thanks so much for the chat—it’s been fun!
Participant: Anytime! If I’ve convinced even one person to leave their car keys behind, I consider it a success.
