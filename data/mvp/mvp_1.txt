Interviewer: Thanks for joining me today. Let’s start with something simple—can you walk me through your typical day, from leaving home to getting to work?
Participant: Sure! I usually wake up around 6:30 a.m., have a light breakfast, and then head out by 7:30. I live about 10 kilometers from my workplace, so I cycle most days. It takes me around 35 to 40 minutes, depending on traffic and weather.
Interviewer: That’s great. So cycling is your main mode of transport?
Participant: Yes, most of the time. I actually switched to biking regularly about two years ago. I used to drive, but I started thinking more about my carbon footprint—and honestly, it just felt better to be more active in the mornings.
Interviewer: Interesting. What motivated that shift?
Participant: A combination of things, really. One big factor was learning more about the environmental impact of daily commuting. I was reading articles and listening to podcasts about climate change, and it struck me that transportation is such a big contributor. I thought, “If I can do something small but consistent, maybe it helps in the long run.” Plus, I enjoy it! It’s energizing and gives me time to think.
Interviewer: Do you ever use other forms of transport?
Participant: Yes, if it’s raining heavily or I’m feeling unwell, I take the bus. It’s pretty reliable, and there’s a bus stop just a few minutes from my flat. I also sometimes carpool with a colleague if we have early meetings.
Interviewer: Sounds like you’re quite flexible. Do you think your workplace supports sustainable commuting?
Participant: Definitely. They actually have a cycle-to-work scheme, which I joined. We also have secure bike storage and showers, which makes it easier. A few of my colleagues have switched to biking too. There’s a really nice culture of encouraging sustainable habits there.
Interviewer: That’s encouraging. Now, thinking more broadly—how do you feel about the way transportation affects the environment?
Participant: I think it’s one of the areas where individual choices can have a real impact. Obviously, we need better infrastructure and policy, but when people choose to cycle, walk, or take public transport, it reduces emissions and traffic congestion. And it often improves quality of life too.
Interviewer: Have you noticed any changes in your own health or lifestyle since you stopped driving?
Participant: Absolutely. I feel fitter, and I’m less stressed during rush hour. Instead of sitting in a jam, I’m cruising past traffic on a bike lane. I also save money on fuel and parking, which adds up. And when I take the bus, I use the time to read or listen to audiobooks. It’s just a more peaceful start to the day.
Interviewer: That’s a great perspective. Do you think more people would make that shift if the infrastructure were better?
Participant: Yes, 100%. I talk to friends who say they’d love to bike or take public transport, but the lack of safe bike lanes or inconsistent bus schedules puts them off. If cities invested more in those systems, I think we’d see a huge change.
Interviewer: Are there any particular changes you'd like to see?
Participant: Definitely more protected bike lanes, and maybe incentives for people to use e-bikes or carpool. Also, improving public transport frequency and making it more affordable. In the end, sustainable choices should be the convenient ones—not the hard ones.
Interviewer: Well said. One last question: what advice would you give to someone considering a more sustainable commute?
Participant: Start small. Maybe bike one or two days a week, or try the bus for a few days and see how it fits your routine. It’s not about being perfect—it’s about being consistent. And don’t underestimate how good it feels to be part of the solution.
Interviewer: Thank you so much. This has been a really inspiring conversation.
Participant: Thank you! I’m glad to share. Hopefully, more people will give it a try.
