  "summary": "The interviewee is an ex-economics teacher, now mostly retired, who lives in a semi-rural environment. Cost influences his travel choices for longer journeys, especially regarding airport travel, where he prefers public transport. Locally, cost is less of a factor. He values the convenience of car travel, especially for work and shopping in Exeter, despite acknowledging its expense. He believes changes in travel behavior will be driven by necessity (congestion, cost) rather than environmental concerns. He favors improving the quality and network of public transport and questions current transport policies, particularly regarding cargo transport.",
  "quotes": [
    "I think when I take longer journeys, when I go abroad, which I do five, six times a year then I am very much more influenced by the cost of getting there.",
    "So I think it is, I think it is expensive but I am prepared to make that choice.",
    "I don’t think I feel any pressure personally to change the way I exist in relation to the environment, global warming, whatever.",
    "I think congestion is likely to bring about the major changes.",
    "I think it’s a quality of the transport provided, I think that’s the key messages, I think there is too much stick and not enough carrot."

  "summary": "The interviewee prioritizes convenience and flexibility in her travel choices, relying heavily on car travel due to the lack of adequate public transport infrastructure in her area. Cost is not a primary factor, but she acknowledges the expense of car ownership and maintenance. She expresses a willingness to use public transport if it were more convenient and affordable, particularly a train station in her town. She is environmentally conscious and supports measures to improve public transport and reduce carbon emissions, but believes global cooperation is necessary.",
  "quotes": [
    "Doesn’t come into it at all really, I don’t think. I can afford to run a car and my husband can afford to run a car and so we run two cars.",
    "Yes we do walk an awful lot of places, we don’t use the car for short journeys, it’s mainly for sort of travelling to Exeter for example and then we would get a park and ride bus into Exeter, so we are sort of using public transport as well, but yes the cost isn’t influencing us in that way.",
    "Not really. No I do use the car as little as possible, preferring to walk when there is time and it’s within walking distance really, but it is expensive to run a car and to maintain a car and it is a biggest waste of money that you’ve go I think.",
    "Definitely because you can go when you want to go, you are not tied by a timetable.",
    "Yes I think so, in this generation certainly will need to think about it in a different way, I think maybe that needs to be an infrastructure set up, not necessarily from individuals I think it needs to be more of an infrastructure put into place for, to make it easier for people to travel on public transport.",
    "Well if we change the way we travel the rest of the world has to take that on board as well, there is no point us doing it and China not having the measures in place as well.",
    "Definitely more links, not rail links, more bus links, more affordable bus links as well, make it more affordable for everyone to change."

  "summary": "The interviewee is a retired individual with a bus pass, who values convenience over cost when it comes to daily travel. While acknowledging the rising fuel prices and their impact, he primarily uses a car for its time efficiency and flexibility. He believes public transport should be cheaper, more frequent, and more accessible. He expresses skepticism towards current transport policies, viewing them as revenue-driven rather than aimed at reducing carbon emissions or encouraging sustainable travel behavior. He is also critical of the effectiveness of cycling facilities and car sharing schemes.",
  "quotes": [
    "I don’t think it has a significant affect on my day to day travel, obviously I’ve noticed a significant increase in the price of fuel, as everybody has and I have strong views about this, I believe that the public, the man in the street is being used by large corporations and also the government to capitalise on profits and I include the government in the profit making as they have got to fund things, but you know there seems to be a sort of a general trend to bleed the public as much as you can.",
    "Well it’s not cost effective if I had the time to use public, I am retired and therefore I have got a bus pass.",
    "Which I am grateful for, not that I use it that much, but I think the convenience of cars out strip the sometimes inconvenience of public transport and I don’t feel in my car that I am tied to anybodies problem, expect my own.",
    "I think there used to be more of a sort of national effort on looking at making public transport more accessible, more frequent, more, and cheaper.",
    "It’s almost like a sort of, it’s an ethos almost isn’t it, we have become slaves to our cars for the very simple reason that it is convenient, if we were, if you were able to make public transport convenient, I am not saying everybody would do it, because there is a world worship of the car, it’s no longer the nice thing that you take out on a Sunday, it’s your left leg, you know or your right arm, you can’t do with it, then the generations that follow me, they are so conditioned to use the car, that they don’t know how to use, it’s a bit like that old song, you know everyone’s gone to the moon, where everybody will be walking around with wheels one day, because they don’t need to use their legs and legs will disappear, people that are born without legs will have wheels.",
    "I don’t think the government wants to change the transport system particularly. I think they want the tax revenue from fuel and I think if you reduced the, the amount of motor cars on the road, you would reduce the fuel tax to the government and therefore they would have to find another way of raising revenue, it’s a bit like the Shylark in Shakespeare, their money lenders, the government are money lenders, it gives you fuel, wants you to use fuel, but doesn’t want you to use fuel, they don’t want you to drive but they want money that you create by driving.",
    "Increased frequency of bus and rail services, obviously that would, I believe that would have, eventually have an impact on and reduce the traffic density and congestion and use of fuel, without a doubt.",
    "Major improvements in cycling facilities, well to an extent I think probably in some cities and Exeter is an example, there has been an overreaction to the incentive to get people on the bike.",
    "Car sharing requires interaction between people, you have got to talk to people, you have got to find out, who they are, what they are doing, where they are going, it’s social interaction that is required to make that work and I think one of the features that would delay it is that people don’t need to act very well in communities like I live in here, this is quite a nice community but it’s a social desert, we don’t talk to anybody, we have a nodding acquaintance with a few neighbours, but if you are in a village environment where my daughter lives, then you can go out in the village, knock on the doors and say hey Fred do you fancy sharing a car with me, it’s a much more personal thing, car sharing can only work that way, it’s a very, you’ve got to know someone, you don’t go up to a stranger and say are you going in my direction, it’s social interaction required to make that work."

She acknowledges the overuse of roads, environmental impact, and diminishing fuel resources as reasons to change travel behavior.

    "Probably not but I suppose I factored it into my life.",
    "Well it would be very expensive because I have got a free bus pass so…",
    "Yes. Because if I do go out, I can do the shopping and go somewhere else at the same time and usually I don’t just do one thing I sort of do a set of, not jobs, but sort of tasks while I am out.",
    "Well certainly the over use of roads, because they are very crowded.",
    "And obviously the influence on the environment and the fuel, becoming shorter and the energy disappearing.",
    "I think that the only way they can influence transport policies is to provide more, I mean I think you will get a lot more people going on buses when they have free bus passes and I don’t see why they can’t make local travel anyway a lot cheaper and a lot more user friendly as it were.",
