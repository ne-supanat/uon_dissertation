Model's outline:
--------------------------------------------------
Model's Topic:
This research explores the motivations and barriers encountered by individuals for adopting more ‘sustainable’ forms of travel behaviour in a range of lifestyle contexts, including travel for work, leisure and holidays. the research seeks to uncover the factors that influence a highly complex set of behaviors related to travel in the UK and explores practical measures for changing current practices amongst different lifestyle groups.

Model's Objective:
To observe the adoption rate of sustainable travel modes under different policy scenarios.

Model's Experimental Factors(Input):
Intervention strategies

Model's Response:
Carbon emissions level


Scenario detail:
--------------------------------------------------
Scenario answer choices:
1. Cycling
2. Cars
3. Public transport
--------------------------------------------------
Scenario questions:
1. Which choice best reflects your current commuting behavior?
2. Which choice would you be most likely to make if public transport reliability significantly improved?
3. Which choice would you be most likely to make if parking charge in urban areas, fuel taxes and car taxes increased?
4. Which choice would you be most likely to make if there are no car day?
